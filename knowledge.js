const PORTFOLIO_KNOWLEDGE = `
I am an Associate Consultant specializing in Oracle Fusion HCM with experience in Core HR, Absence, and Benefits.

I enjoy solving enterprise problems using Fast Formulas and business rule configurations.

I have a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Agentic AI.
I actively use AI to learn topics, build websites, create AI agents, and generate images for social media.

One of my key achievements includes configuring an Oracle Fusion Absence rule
where leave is not applied if the start time is earlier than 8:30 AM or the end time is later than 4:30 PM,
a solution previously considered not possible.

My career goal is not to be fixed to one domain.
I want to help people across different walks of life using technology and eventually build my own company
capable of generating ₹90 crore INR annually in today’s terms.
